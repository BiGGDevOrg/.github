# BiGGDev 

Hello! We are BiGGDev, a small team of dedicated software programmers that spend time developing projects from ideas that we generate and think are useful. Recently we have been developing an educational studying software using sets of cards (of terms and definitions), Quizlet style, except it's actually functional and not pay-to-study.

Current Developers: [greateric](https://github.com/greatericontop), [gerseneck](https://github.com/gerseneck), and [ez500](https://github.com/ez500).
